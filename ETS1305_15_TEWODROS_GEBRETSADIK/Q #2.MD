 Problem Analysis:
The program is designed to calculate the number of miles an automobile can be driven without refueling based on the capacity in gallons and miles per gallon of the automobile. 
The main problem with this program is that it does not include any error handling for invalid inputs, such as negative values for gallons and miles per gallon.
Additionally, it does not provide any additional information or interpretation of the calculated number of miles, such as comparing it to the distance of a specific trip or providing a warning if the number of miles is low.
Algorithm Design:
1. Declare variables for gallons, milesPerGallon, and miles as double data types.
2. Prompt the user to enter the capacity in gallons of the automobile and store the input in the variable gallons.
3. Prompt the user to enter the miles per gallon of the automobile and store the input in the variable milesPerGallon.
4. Calculate the number of miles the automobile can be driven by multiplying gallons and milesPerGallon, and store the result in the variable miles.
5. Display the number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling.
6. output the result
