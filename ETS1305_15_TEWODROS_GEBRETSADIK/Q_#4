Problem Analysis:
The program is designed to take two integer inputs, x and y, and calculate the result of x raised to the power of y using the 'pow' function from the 'cmath' library. 
The main problem with this program is that it does not handle any error cases, such as non-integer inputs or negative values for y, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.
Algorithm Design:
1. Declare two variables 'x' and 'y' of type int.
2. Prompt the user to enter the value of x and store the input in the variable 'x'.
3. Prompt the user to enter the value of y and store the input in the variable 'y'.
4. Calculate the result of x raised to the power of y using the 'pow' function from the 'cmath' library and store it in a variable 'result'.
5. print the result of x raised to the power of y.
