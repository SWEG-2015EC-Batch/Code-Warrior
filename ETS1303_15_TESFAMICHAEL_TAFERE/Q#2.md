Problem Analysis:

The problem requires developing a program that calculates and displays the number of miles an automobile can be driven without refueling based on the capacity of its fuel tank and the miles per gallon it can travel. The key components of the problem include:

Input: The program needs to prompt the user to enter the capacity in gallons of the automobile's fuel tank and the miles per gallon it can travel.
Validation: Ensure that the entered values for fuel tank capacity and miles per gallon are valid numerical values.
Calculation: Calculate the number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling using the formula: 
Miles
=
Fuel Tank Capacity
×
Miles Per Gallon
Miles=Fuel Tank Capacity×Miles Per Gallon
Output: Display the calculated number of miles.
Algorithm Design:

Input:

Prompt the user to input the capacity in gallons of the automobile's fuel tank.
Prompt the user to input the miles per gallon the automobile can travel.
Validation:

Ensure that the entered fuel tank capacity and miles per gallon are valid numerical values.
Calculation:

Calculate the number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling using the formula: 
Miles
=
Fuel Tank Capacity
×
Miles Per Gallon
Miles=Fuel Tank Capacity×Miles Per Gallon
Output:

Display the calculated number of miles.

pseudocode:  
1. Display("Enter the capacity in gallons of the automobile's fuel tank:")
2. Input fuelTankCapacity
3. Validate fuelTankCapacity is a valid numerical value
4. Display("Enter the miles per gallon the automobile can travel:")
5. Input milesPerGallon
6. Validate milesPerGallon is a valid numerical value
7. Calculate milesWithoutRefueling = fuelTankCapacity * milesPerGallon
8. Display("The automobile can be driven for approximately", milesWithoutRefueling, "miles without refueling.")
