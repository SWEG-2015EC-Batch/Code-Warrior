Problem Analysis:

The problem is to create a C++ program that calculates how long it will take to send a file over a serial transmission line. The transmission line can transmit 960 characters per second. The key components of the problem include:

Input:Prompt the user to input the size of the file in characters.
Validation:

Ensure that the entered value for the file size is a valid numerical value.
Calculation:

Calculate the time it will take to send the file using the formula: 
Time (seconds)=File Size (characters)

Transmission Rate (characters per second)
Time (seconds)=
Transmission Rate (characters per second)
File Size (characters)
​
 
Output:Display the calculated time in seconds.
Algorithm Design:

Input:Prompt the user to input the size of the file in characters.
Validation:Ensure that the entered value for the file size is a valid numerical value.

Calculation:Calculate the time it will take to send the file using the formula: 
Time (seconds)=File Size (characters)
Transmission Rate (characters per second)
Time (seconds)= Transmission Rate (characters per second)
File Size (characters)
​
 
Output:Display the calculated time in seconds.


pseudocode: 1. Display("Enter the size of the file in characters:")
2. Input fileSize
3. Validate fileSize is a valid numerical value
4. Calculate timeInSeconds = fileSize / 960
5. Display("It will take approximately", timeInSeconds, "seconds to send the file.")
