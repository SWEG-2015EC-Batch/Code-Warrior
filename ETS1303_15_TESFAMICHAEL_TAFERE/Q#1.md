Problem Analysis:The problem at hand is to create a program that calculates and displays the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person. BMI is a measure of body fat based on an individual's weight and height. The formula to calculate BMI is:

BMI=weight/(height*height)

Where:weight is the weight of the person in kilograms. height is the height of the person in meters.The program needs to read the height and weight of a person, calculate the BMI using the given formula, and then display the result.

Algorithm Design:

Input:Prompt the user to input their weight in kilograms.Prompt the user to input their height in meters.
Validation:Ensure that the entered weight and height are valid numerical values. 
BMI Calculation:Calculate BMI using the formula: 

BMI=weight/(height*height)
â€‹
 Output:Display the calculated BMI.
