**Problem Analysis**

a) Algorithm to print numbers 10 through 49 in a specific manner:

Set a variable 'count' to 10.
While 'count' is less than or equal to 49, perform the following steps:
a. Calculate the modulo of 'count' divided by 10.
b. If the modulo is 0, print a new line.
c. Print the value of 'count' followed by a space.
d. Increment 'count' by 1.
End the program.
