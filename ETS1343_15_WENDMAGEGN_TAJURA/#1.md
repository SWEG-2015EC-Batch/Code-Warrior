𝐰𝐞𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭
𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭∗𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭
➢ Problem analysis
Input
✓ Weight of a person
✓ Height of a person
Output
✓ Display BMI of a person
➢ Process or Operation
▪ Variable declaration: that holds an input and operational results.
▪ Print input prompt message and read corresponding input.
▪ Calculate the BMI of a person.
▪ Print output prompt message and process result (BMI).
➢ Design the program
• Variable declaration (What and How)
Float weight, height, BMI;
• Reading input data (How)
Cout << “please enter the weight and the height of the person ”;
Cin >> weight, >> height;
BMI = 
𝐰𝐞𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 /
(𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭∗𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭)
Cout << “The BMI of the person is: ” << BMI << “Kg/m2 ”;
