    step 1 = start
    step 2 = read gross salary, worked gour, income tax rate and bonus rate.
    step 3 = income tax = gross salary * income tax rate and pension = gross salary *0.07.
    step 4 = if worked hour > 40 go to step 5 else go to step 6
    step 5 = over_time_payment = (worked_hours-40)*bonus_rate.
    step 6 = over time payment = 0
    step 7 = net salary = (gross_salary -(income_tax + pension) ) + over_time_payment.
    step 8 = print net salary.
    step 9 = stop
