    input = row colum and nested(special case), shape 
    process = if the user entered shape = a -- rectangle 
    b-- half pyramid 
    c --inverted half pyramid 
    d-- fliiped half pyramid 
    e -- inverse of flipped pyramid 
    f -- inverted full pyramid 
    g -- full pyramid 
    h -- for all. 
    for rectangle row will run in for loop with i = 10; i < 50; i++ and colum = j = j + 1; break line after itiration
        if (j % 10 == 0) display j then break line. 
    for inverted half pyramid row will run in for with  i1 = 1; i1 <= 49; i1++ after the all itration brea the line 
       and column will run also in  for loop with j1 = 10; j1 <= i1; j1++ then print it after that break the line
    for fliiped half pyramid the row will run in for loop with i2 = 10; i2 <= 49; ++i2 and break after all itiration
           and the column will run in for loop  j2 = i2; j2 <= 49; ++j2  and will display pre intialized b with 10 then increment it
         after that we will reintialize it again with 10 then break the line
    for inverted of flipped pyramid row will run in for loop with i3 = 10; i3 <= 49; i3++ and after the all itration break the line 
         the column will run with int j3 = 10; j3 <= (59 - i3); j3++ and display "  " break line after itiration
    for inverted full pyramid for row will run in for loop with  i4 = 10; i4 <= 49; ++i4 break line after itiration
         the column will run in for loop with  int j4 = 10; j4 <= 49; ++j4
    
         and we will put condition if j4 >= i4 if it is we will print in the predintialized d (10) the will incrimente it. 
            else we will display "  "
    for full pyramid we will run row with for loop with i5 = 10; i5 <= 49; ++i5 break line after itiration
      and the column with 5 = 10; j5 <= 49; ++j5 in for loop
        and we will put condition if j5 >= i5 if it is we will print in the predintialized e (10) the will incrimente it. 
            else we will display " "
        
       output = the for looped conditions.
