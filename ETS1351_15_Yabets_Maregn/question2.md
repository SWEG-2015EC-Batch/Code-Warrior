                                     analysis
    input the amount of fuel in gallon the automobile fuel tank has and the miles per gallons the automobile can be driven
      process number of miles = amount of fuel  *  mile per gallon
        output number of mile

                            algorithm
     step 1 start
    step 2 read the amount of fuel in gallon the automobile fuel tank has and the miles per gallons the automobile can be driven
     step 3 assign "the amount of fuel in gallon the automobile fuel tank has" as fuel_amt 
    and "the miles per gallons the automobile can be driven" as mile_per_hour
    and number of mile the car can goes as "num_mile"
    step 4 num_mile = fuel_amt * mile_per_hour
    step 5 print num_mile
    step 6 stop
