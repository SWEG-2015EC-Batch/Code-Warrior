process amount of  character= 960 byte= 960 character
        time_taken  = amount_of_bytes / amt character
        time_taken_inday = time_taken / 60*60*24
output  time taken 

algorithm
step 1 = start
step 2 =  assign amount character = 960
step 3= assign amount of transferring  data = 419430400
step 4= time taken to transfer  =  amount of transferring  data / amount character
step 5= time_taken_indays =  time taken / 60*60*24
step 6 display time_taken, time_taken indays
step 7 = stop
