analysis 
input there is no input it is already given
process amount of  character= 960 byte= 960 character
        time taken  = amount of bytes / amt character
output  time taken 

algorithm
step 1 = start
step 2 =  assign amount character = 960
step 3= assign amount of transferring  data = 419430400
step 4= time taken to transfer  =  amount of transferring  data / amount character
step 5 display time taken to transfer
step 6 = stop
